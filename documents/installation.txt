Even if you have Eclipse or Java already installed, read all the directions and make sure you don't miss anything. Installing the plugins is especially important.
Ignore anything that mentions C/C++.
Set the workspace to wherever you keep your GRT code.

Next you must install the CTRE library in order to use the CAN talons.

Click on CTRE Toolsuite. The I would recommend downloading the file that says "(No Installer)" under "Stable Installer".
You can then follow the pdf guide or the guide on the page I linked before, or you can use my instructions:
Extract the zip file (to downloads or whatever).
Copy the java folder and paste it into /wpilib/user (look at the link to find that folder).
It might ask you to replace an existing folder, click yes.

Next, clone the repository into your workspace.
Open eclipse.
File->importâ€¦
